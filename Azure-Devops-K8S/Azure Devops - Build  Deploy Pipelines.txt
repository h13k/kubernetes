Azure AKS - Azure Devops - Build & Push Docker Image to ACR, Publish Artifacts - Starter Pipeline:

Environments: Dev, Qa, Staging, Production 
	
	- bash: echo Contents in System Default Working Directory: ls -R $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)
	- bash: echo Before copying in Build Artifact Directory: ls -R $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)
	#Task-2: Copy files (copy files from a source to target folder)
	#Source Directory: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/kube-manifests
	#Target Directory: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)

	- task: CopyFiles@2
	  inputs:
	    SourceFolder: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/kube-manifests'
	    Contents: '**'
	    TargetFolder: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
	    OverWrite: true
	#Task-3: Publish build Arifacts (publish build to Azure Pipeline)

	- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
	  inputs:
	    PathtoPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
	    ArtifactName: 'Kube-manifests'
	    publishLocation: 'Container' 


	 Build & Push Docker Image to ACR, Publish Artifacts through Azure Pipelines:

	Stages: Jobs will run on agents under stages
		
		steps: tasks will run under jobs
		       step-1: script: echo Hello, world!
		       step-2: Task-1: Docker Build & Push to ACR
		       step-3: Task-2: Copy Files to Build Artifact Directory.
		       step-4: Task-3: Publish Artifacts to Azure Pipleines.

	Azure Pipelines - Starter Pipeline
		
	Goal: Create a Pipeline that will build docker images, push them to Azure Container Registry and Public Kubernetes Manifests to Azure Pipelines.
	Part-1 Semi Customized							Part-2 Fully Customized using Starter Pipeline
	Task-1 Use Pre-defined Docker Build and Push Pipeline.			Task-1: Start using Starter pipeline and use Docker Build or push Docker Images Task
	Task-2 Customize Pipeline to Use Copy Files Task			Task-2: Customize Pipeline Use Copy Files Task
	Task-3 Customize Pipeline to use Publish Build Arifacts Task		Task-3: Customize Pipeline to Use Publish Build Artifacts Task
