Release Pipelines:

	To achieve Continous Delivery we should use Release Pipelines.

	Release pipelines for pre-production & production stages:

	CI build -> Dev		QA		Pre-production		Production   
		    
		    Dev		QA		Pre-production		Production   -	Stages
		    Servers	Servers		Servers			Servers

	1. Create Namespaces in k8s cluster and map those namespaces which are in k8s cluster to azure devops pipelines through service connection:

	kubectl get namespace dev
	kubectl get namespace qa
	kubectl get namespace staging
	kubectl get namespace prod 

	Create service connections for Dev, QA, Staging and Prod Namespace in k8s cluster.
	Add Artifact
	Enable Continous deployment trigger.
	Create Dev Stage and Test
		Stage Name: Dev
		Create Task
		Agent Job: change to Ubuntu Linux (latest)
	Add Task: Create Secret
	display Name: Create Secret to allow image pull from ACR
	Action: Create secret
	Deploy to AKS
	we can create multiple release pipelines  by cloning existing dev namespace related release pipeline
