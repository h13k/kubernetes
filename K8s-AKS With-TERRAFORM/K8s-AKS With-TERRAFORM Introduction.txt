TERRAFORM: 

	1. Use Infrastructure as a code to provision and manage any cloud, infrastructure, or service
	2. Deliver Infrastructure as a code with Terraform
	3. Write declarative configuration files.
	4. Plan and predict changes
	5. Create a reproducible infrastructure
		1. Reproducible production, stagging, and development environments
		2. shared modules for common infrastructure patterns.
		3. Combine multiple providers consistently
	        4. Terraform makes it easy to re-use configuration for similar infrastructure, helping us to avoid 
		   manual mistakes and saves time.
	6. Commands:
		1. terraform version
		2. terraform init
		3. terraform plan
		4. terraform validate
		5. terraform apply
		6. terraform show
		7. terraform refresh
		8. terraform providers
		9. terraform destroy
	7. Enhanced Workflow for Teams with Terraform Cloud
		1. Terraform Cloud is a free to use SaaS application that provides the best workflow for writing and building
		   infrastructure as code with Terraform
		2. Share infrastructure as code: Empower our team to rapidly review, comment, and iterate on infrastructure as Code.
			1. State management (storage, viewing, histroy, and locking).
			2. Web UI for viewing and approving Terraform runs. 
			3. Collaborative Runs.
			4. Private module registry.
		3. Automate consistent workflows
			1. Create a pipeline for provisioning infrastructure as Code.
			2. VCS integration (Azure DevOps, Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab).
			3. Enable GitOps workflow.
			4. Remote operations - Perform Terraforms runs in a consistent, immutable environment.
			5. Notifications for run events (via Stack or webhooks).
			6. Full HTTP API for integrating with other tools and services.
	8. Providers:
		Terraform is used to create, manage and update infrastructure resources such as physical machines, VMs, network switches, containers, and more.
		Almost any infrastructure type can be represented as a source in Terraform.
		A Provider is responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources. Most providers configure a specific infrastructure platform
		(either cloud or self-hosted). Providers can also offer local utilities for tasks like generating random numbers for unique resource names.
