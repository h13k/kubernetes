StatefulSet for stateful applications:

	stateful applications: 
		All Databases - MySQL, Elasticsearch, MongoDB
		Any application that stores data to keep track of its state.
		saving the information in some storage.
		stateful applications will be deployed using statefulset
	stateless applications:
		stateless applicatios connect to the stateful application to forward those requests.
		Doesnt depends on previous data, It can handle it based on the payload in the request itself.
		stateless applications will be deployed using deployment

	Both stateful and stateless applications deployed in different ways using 
	different components in kubernetes.
	Both manage Pods based on identical container specification.
	configure storage with both of the equally.
	Bothe manage the replication of PODS and also configuration of data persistance in the same way
