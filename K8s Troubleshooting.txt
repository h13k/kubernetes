what are the troubleshooting scenarios in kuberenetes?

There are several troubleshooting scenarios in Kubernetes. Some common scenarios include:

Pod issues: This is one of the most common troubleshooting scenarios in Kubernetes. Pods can have issues such as being stuck in a pending state, crashing, or failing to start.
	    This can be caused by various factors such as misconfigured containers, lack of resources, network issues, or failing health checks.

Networking issues: Networking problems can occur in Kubernetes due to various reasons, including misconfigured networking policies, network congestion, and DNS resolution issues.
		   Troubleshooting network problems in Kubernetes involves checking network configurations, verifying network connectivity, and diagnosing DNS resolution issues.

Cluster resource issues: Resource issues such as CPU or memory constraints can cause problems in Kubernetes.
			 When resources are exhausted, pods may become unresponsive or crash.
			 In this scenario, it is essential to diagnose the root cause of resource exhaustion and allocate additional resources or optimize resource usage.

Kubernetes API issues: Issues with the Kubernetes API can cause problems in the cluster, such as nodes not being able to join the cluster, 
		       pods not being created or deleted, or services not being exposed. 
		       Troubleshooting API issues requires checking API server logs and diagnosing connectivity issues.

Storage issues: Storage problems can occur in Kubernetes due to various factors, including misconfigured storage classes, storage provider issues, and lack of available storage.
		Diagnosing and troubleshooting storage issues in Kubernetes requires checking storage class configurations, 
		verifying connectivity to storage providers, and diagnosing storage capacity issues.

Pod scheduling issues: When a pod cannot be scheduled due to resource constraints or node affinity rules, 
			it may need to be rescheduled to a different node.

Pod crashes or failures: When a pod crashes or fails to start, it may be due to misconfiguration or resource constraints. 
			 Logs and events can help identify the issue.

Networking issues: When network connectivity is disrupted or misconfigured, 
		   pods may not be able to communicate with each other or with external services.

Storage issues: When there are issues with persistent volumes or storage resources, 
		pods may fail to start or data may be lost.

API server issues: When there are issues with the Kubernetes API server, it can impact the entire cluster and 
		   cause issues with deployments and other resources.

Cluster upgrades: When upgrading the Kubernetes version or other cluster components, there may be issues with compatibility or 
		  configuration that need to be addressed.

Security issues: When there are security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations, it can lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.

In summary, troubleshooting in Kubernetes requires a systematic approach, including gathering information,
diagnosing the root cause of the problem, and applying the appropriate fix
