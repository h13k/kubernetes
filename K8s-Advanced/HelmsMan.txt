What is Helmsman?
		
	Helmsman is a Helm Charts (k8s applications) as Code tool which allows you to automate the deployment/management of your Helm charts from 
	version controlled code.

	TOML is a file format for configuration files:
		"TOML" is an acronym for "Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language"[6] referring to its creator, Tom Preston-Werner.
	
	Use cases

		TOML is used in a variety of settings (some related to its creator), such as:

			1. Static site generators like Jekyll and Hugo
			2. Continuous integration on e.g. GitHub and GitLab
			3. Python programming language
			4. Rust programming language

	Helmsman uses a simple declarative TOML file to allow you to describe a desired state for your k8s applications as in the example toml file. Alternatively YAML declaration is also acceptable example yaml file.

	The desired state file (DSF) follows the desired state specification.

	Helmsman sees what you desire, validates that your desire makes sense (e.g. that the charts you desire are available in the repos you defined), 
	compares it with the current state of Helm and figures out what to do to make your desire come true.

	To plan without executing:

		helmsman -f example.toml

	To plan and execute the plan:

		helmsman --apply -f example.toml

	To show debugging details:

		helmsman --debug --apply -f example.toml

	To run a dry-run:

		helmsman --debug --dry-run -f example.toml

	To limit execution to specific application:

		helmsman --debug --dry-run --target artifactory -f example.toml
